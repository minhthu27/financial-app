# Personal Finance Management
## Overview
This report aims to analyze and build a personal finance management application based on object-oriented programming. The main goal of the application is to support users to:
+ Manage personal income and expenses in detail, by category.
+ Make a budget and track progress.
+ Generate financial reports to evaluate the overall income and expenditure situation over time.
By applying OOP, the application will be structured in a clear model, easy to maintain and flexible, allowing for future feature expansion.
